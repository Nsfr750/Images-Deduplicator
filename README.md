## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- ImageMagick 7.0.0 or higher
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Installation

### 1. Install System Dependencies

#### Windows
1. Download and install ImageMagick from [https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows)
2. During installation, make sure to check "Add application directory to your system path"

#### macOS
```bash
brew install imagemagick
```

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libmagickwand-dev
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nsfr750/Images-Deduplicator.git
   cd Images-Deduplicator
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Click "Browse" to select a folder to scan for duplicates
3. Click "Compare" to start the duplicate detection process
4. Review the found duplicates in the list
5. Use the preview panel to compare images side by side
6. Select duplicates to delete or use the "Delete All Duplicates" button
7. Use "Undo" to restore any deleted files if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Wand/ImageMagick Issues
- If you get `Wand` import errors, ensure ImageMagick is properly installed and in your system PATH
- On Windows, you may need to restart your terminal/IDE after installing ImageMagick
- For Linux, you might need to install additional development packages:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y libmagickwand-dev
  ```

### Performance Tips
- For large image collections, increase the chunk size in the settings
- Use the "Preserve Metadata" option only when necessary as it can slow down processing
- Close other memory-intensive applications when working with large numbers of images
